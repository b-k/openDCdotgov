## What government information should be more readily available online or more easily searched?

[Eric Mill](/konklone): The DC Register is not published in a form that can be easily searched or reused. For example, the [August 30th issue of the DC Register](http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/IssueHome.aspx?IssueId=411) is available as a mixture of PDFs and Word DOCs. Some of the PDFs have searchable text, and some do not. The issue is available as [a single combined PDF](http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?IssueFileID=38235), but it retains the searchability problem of its constituent parts. For example, I was able to use simple text extraction tools to extract [this text from the Aug 30 DCR](https://gist.github.com/konklone/7352947). It includes text from pages 19-20, but not pages 8-18. When the DC Register is distributed this way, it makes it impossible for citizens to perform basic oversight of the actions of the DC Government, or for developers to build tools that give citizens greater ability to perform this oversight. For example, a [dccode.org](http://dccode.org/browser/)-like project with the DC Register would be much more limited and incomplete than what was able to be done for the DC Code. By contrast, the Federal Register, as published at [federalregister.gov](https://www.federalregister.gov) publishes the activity of the federal government in a wonderful, open manner, for citizens and developers alike. This makes it possible for engaged citizens with specific interests to follow relevant activity in a reliable, timely manner.
